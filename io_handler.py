#Hey Pranati!

# I suggest that you make a new directory (name can be io) and make other .py files related to this file.
# Also you can have a .txt file in that folder to save the address of input files. You can hardcode the addresses or
# input file names for now but we'll have to make it cleaner later

def get_network(input_addresses):
    # your code here
    return list_of_densities, adjacency_matrix
    # return matrix with numpy array. That should be more efficient


def show_network(list_of_segment):
    # plot the network with each segment defined with a color
    # the input is list with len=|V| each element shows the seg# for each link
    # ex: we have 4 segments, the list would be like: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1 ,...]
